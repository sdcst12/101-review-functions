## Assignment

### Assignment 1
#### Calculation of Simple Interest
The simple interest formula is I = P*r*t where I = the amount of interest, P is the principal or the amount invested, r is the interest rate per year (converted to a decimal) and t is the length of time in years.
Write a program that calculates the amount of simple interest for an investment.

Criteria:
Your program should ask the user for 
* an initial investment
* the annual interest rate as a percentage
* the length of time.
  * the user should have the option of entering in the length of time in years, months or days
* The program will calculate the amount of interest earned and display it.
* Appropriate formatting of the output is a requirement for this assignment
* your program should make use of appropriate variable names
* you will need to make use of conditional (if) statements to determine how the time is being calculated
* your program should prevent invalid input (alphanumeric characters that cannot be interpreted as numbers)


### Assignment 2
#### Calculation of an investment with a recurring deposit
The simple interest formula only works if the principal or initial investment is not touched.  If an amount is added to the principal every year, then the interest must be calculated and added along with the future deposit to determine the starting balance at the beginning of the next year.

For example, suppose you invest $100 every year, and earn 5% interest per year.
At the start of the first year, you will have your $100 that you invested.  At the start of the second year, you will have the initial $100, $5 interest as well as an additional $100 that is invested in the second year, for a total of $205 dollars.  Write a program that uses a for loop to determine the amount of money in an account after a certain number of years.

Criteria:
Your program should ask the user for
* the annual investment
* the annual interest rate (as a percentage)
* the number of years
* calculate the amount of money at the end of each year until the specified number of years has been reached.
* appropriate formatting and variable names will be important
* use a *for* loop to iterate through the years.

### Assignment 3
#### Calculation of an investment with a recurring depositS
This will be the same as assignment 2 except you must use a while loop to iterate through your years.
The simple interest formula only works if the principal or initial investment is not touched.  If an amount is added to the principal every year, then the interest must be calculated and added along with the future deposit to determine the starting balance at the beginning of the next year.

For example, suppose you invest $100 every year, and earn 5% interest per year.
At the start of the first year, you will have your $100 that you invested.  At the start of the second year, you will have the initial $100, $5 interest as well as an additional $100 that is invested in the second year, for a total of $205 dollars.  Write a program that uses a while loop to determine the amount of money in an account after a certain number of years.

Criteria:
Your program should ask the user for
* the annual investment
* the annual interest rate (as a percentage)
* the number of years
* calculate the amount of money at the end of each year until the specified number of years has been reached.
* appropriate formatting and variable names will be important
* use a *while* loop to iterate through the years.

### Assignment 4
#### Calculation of a debt repayment with recurring payments
This is the reverse of assignments 2 and 3

Calculate how long it will take to completely pay off a debt if regular annual payments are made.  Note that each year, the debt will increase by the amount of loan interest, but will decrease with youre recurring payment. 

Criteria:
Your program should ask the user for
* an initial debt
* the annual interest rate
* the annual payment
* the program will state how long it will take for the debt to be repaid.
* extra: Calculate the total amount of interest that is paid along with the debt repayment
